@lxndroc Toy (1996) but working on modern PCs

# What is Toy?
Toy is a 1996 game about a clone of the player. The clone is trapped in a cage and it desperately needs help from the player. 
The player has to free the clone, put it in the door, then come back for the ladder and go into the door himself. That's the end of the game.

# What is Pinecone?
Since Toy is a 27 year old game, it obviously doesn't work with modern computers out of the box. Pinecone is a revival project for Toy, although it also has some quality 
modifications built in it too.
